# What is R?

R is a programming language and environment for statistical computing and graphics, created by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman in the early 1990s. It offers a large ecosystem of packages for data analysis, visualization, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

Many R packages are written in R itself; for computationally intensive tasks, high-performance code is often written in C, C++, or Fortran and then exposed to R.

R is widely used in academia and in industry (e.g., technology, healthcare, finance) for data science, reporting, and automation.

A typical data analysis workflow in R often follows these steps:

- **Program**: Use R as a clear and accessible programming tool.
- **Transform**: Clean and reshape data using packages designed for data science.
- **Discover**: Explore the data, refine hypotheses, and perform analysis.
- **Model**: Fit statistical and machine learning models.
- **Communicate**: Produce reports with R Markdown or build interactive apps with Shiny.

# What is R used for?

R is commonly used for:

- Statistical inference.
- Data analysis and reporting.
- Machine learning.

# R by industry

If we break down the use of R by industry, academia is typically the largest user. R is a language built for statistics, and it is also widely used in healthcare, government, and consulting.

# R packages

The primary uses of R have always been statistics, visualization, and (in recent years) machine learning.

The figure below shows which R packages receive the most questions on Stack Overflow. Many of the top packages relate to the core workflow of data science: data preparation and communicating results.

Most R packages are distributed through CRAN (the Comprehensive R Archive Network), a free and open-source repository. You can install thousands of packages from CRAN to perform tasks such as time series analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning.

# Communicating with R

R offers multiple ways to present and share results, from documents to interactive web applications:

- **R Markdown** for reports, slides, and websites.
- **Shiny** for interactive web applications.
- Hosting options include RPubs, GitHub Pages, or your organization’s website.

Below is an example of a presentation hosted on RPubs: <https://rpubs.com/>

RStudio supports R Markdown and lets you export documents in several formats, including:

- Documents: HTML, PDF (LaTeX)
- Presentations: HTML, PDF (Beamer)

# Why use R?

Data science is changing how companies and institutions work. Choosing a tool is a trade-off: easier tools are quick to learn but may be limiting for advanced analysis; powerful tools often require more time to learn.

The figure below shows an example of this trade-off between learning curve and “business capability”.

Tools such as Excel or Power BI are often easier to learn, but they can be limiting for statistical modeling. Python and SAS are widely used in analytics: SAS is a commercial, “click-and-run” ecosystem, while Python is flexible and strong for deployment and software engineering.

R is often a good compromise: it supports statistical modeling, modern data workflows, and strong reporting/communication through R Markdown and Shiny.

Stack Overflow is a large community for programming. Over the years, interest in R has grown strongly, reflecting its popularity in data science.

In data science, the two most common programming languages are R and Python.

# Should you choose R?

Many data scientists use both R and Python, but learning one language well is usually better than trying to learn both at the same time.

In many projects, the most important skills are not the language itself but the *data workflow*: importing data, cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and communication of results. A programming language is mainly a tool to implement and share this work.

Because business and research contexts require communication (reports, dashboards, web apps), R can be a strong choice thanks to its integrated ecosystem.

# Is R difficult?

In the past, R could feel difficult, especially for data manipulation. The ecosystem improved significantly with packages such as the **tidyverse**, which made many common tasks more consistent and easier to learn.

Modern R supports a broad range of machine learning tools. For example, interfaces exist for TensorFlow/Keras, and packages such as xgboost are widely used in competitions and real-world applications.

R also integrates with other languages and platforms: you can call Python or C++ from R, and connect to big-data tools and databases.

# Summary

R is a powerful tool to explore data, build models, and communicate results. It is widely used for tasks such as clustering, correlation analysis, and dimensionality reduction, and it integrates well with reproducible reporting.

# Download R

Go to <https://cran.r-project.org>. Precompiled binary distributions are available for all major operating systems:

- [Download R for Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/)
- [Download R for macOS](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/)
- [Download R for Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/)

# What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. It provides:

- A console and a syntax-highlighting editor.
- Tools for plotting, debugging, history, and workspace management.

RStudio is available in open-source and commercial editions. It runs as a desktop app (Windows, macOS, Linux) or in a browser via RStudio Server.

# Download RStudio

Go to <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/> and download the installer for your operating system.

After downloading, double-click the installer to begin installation (e.g., `.dmg` on macOS and `.exe` on Windows), then follow the prompts.
