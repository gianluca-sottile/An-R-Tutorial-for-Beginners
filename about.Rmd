## Prerequisities
***
Basic notions of descriptive and inferential statistics and  minimal computer skills (Windows, Mac or Linux). It is required that each attendee brings his own device. 

## Expected results
***
__Knowledge:__ outline of the programming environment R, description of the main objects used in R,  list of the commands to import and export data, description and identification of the appropriate inferential tools, interpretation of the result outcomes.

__Skills:__ general use of R programming environment, create and manipulate R objects, build tables and graphs, use of data import/export functions, build user-defined functions, identification of the statistical model to analyse collected data.

__Communication skills:__ Use tables and plots to present results, critical assessment of the results obtained.

__Learning skills:__ Use R as a programming environment.

## Objectives
***
At the end of the course the student will be able to:

1. Use the R software environment for basic statistical analyses;
1. Analyse data using basic statistical model and synthetize results
1. Make a critical assessment of the main outcomes.


## Textbook
