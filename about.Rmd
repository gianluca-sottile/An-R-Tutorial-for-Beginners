## Prerequisites
***

This 9 ECTS (approximately 72 contact hours) course is designed for students with a basic background in descriptive and inferential statistics, including familiarity with concepts such as random variables, probability distributions, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing. A minimal level of computer literacy on Windows, macOS, or Linux is required, including the ability to manage files and folders, install software, and navigate standard graphical user interfaces.

No prior experience with R is strictly required; however, previous exposure to any programming language (e.g., Python, MATLAB, C, or Java) is beneficial and will facilitate faster progression through the programming components of the course. Participants are expected to bring their own device (laptop) with administrative rights, on which they can install R, RStudio (or an equivalent IDE), and any additional packages used during the lectures and labs.

## Course Description
***

This course offers a structured and comprehensive introduction to the R programming language as a modern environment for data analysis, statistical computing, and reproducible research. Starting from the fundamentals of R syntax and core data structures, the course progressively covers user‑defined functions, control structures, and vectorized programming patterns that are essential for writing clear, efficient, and reusable code.

A substantial part of the course is devoted to data management and transformation, including importing and exporting data from multiple formats, handling missing values, reshaping tables, and preparing analysis‑ready data sets. Students will then learn how to perform exploratory data analysis and produce informative visualizations to summarize univariate and multivariate patterns, using R’s base graphics and, where appropriate, more advanced plotting tools.

In the final portion, the course introduces the foundations of machine learning with R, with a clear distinction between supervised and unsupervised approaches. Supervised learning topics include regression and classification models, while unsupervised learning covers dimensionality reduction techniques and clustering methods for exploratory pattern discovery. Throughout, emphasis is placed on good programming practice, critical assessment of model outputs, and reproducible workflows suitable for academic and applied research.

## Expected Outcomes
***

### Knowledge

By the end of the course, students will:

- Understand the role of R as a statistical programming environment for data analysis, visualization, and reporting.
- Recognize and describe the main R object types (vectors, matrices, arrays, factors, lists, and data frames) and their typical use cases.
- Know the syntax and semantics of fundamental R constructs, including functions, conditional statements, and loops, as well as their vectorized counterparts and apply‑family functions.
- Be familiar with standard procedures for importing and exporting data from and to common formats (CSV, text, Excel, SPSS, etc.), and with basic strategies for handling missing data.
- Understand the basic principles of exploratory data analysis and data visualization, including measures of association, distributions, and graphical summaries.
- Grasp core concepts in supervised learning (regression and classification) and unsupervised learning (dimensionality reduction and clustering), including typical evaluation criteria and limitations.

### Skills

Upon successful completion, students will be able to:

- Install, configure, and effectively navigate the R and RStudio environments, manage R projects, and work with scripts and R Markdown documents.
- Create, index, subset, and manipulate R objects, including transforming raw inputs into structured data frames suitable for analysis.
- Write and debug user‑defined functions, implement control structures (if/else, for, while), and translate iterative code into vectorized or apply‑based solutions when appropriate.
- Import and export data in a variety of file formats, manage missing values, recode variables, merge and reshape data sets, and derive new variables in a principled way.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis, compute descriptive statistics, and produce high‑quality tables and graphics that communicate key findings clearly.
- Fit, interpret, and critically evaluate basic supervised learning models (e.g., linear and generalized linear models, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting) in R.
- Apply unsupervised learning methods, such as principal component analysis and clustering algorithms, to explore high‑dimensional data and identify latent structure.

### Communication Skills

The course also aims to strengthen students’ ability to:

- Present empirical results in a clear, concise, and reproducible manner using well‑structured tables, graphics, and written summaries generated directly from R.
- Explain methodological choices, assumptions, and limitations of the applied statistical and machine learning techniques, both in written form and, when required, through oral presentation.
- Engage in critical discussion of analytical results, highlighting potential biases, sources of uncertainty, and implications for decision‑making or further research.

### Learning Skills

In addition, students will:

- Develop autonomy in learning new R functions, packages, and workflows by consulting documentation, vignettes, and online resources.
- Gain confidence in using R as a primary tool for data analysis in academic and professional contexts, enabling further self‑directed study in advanced statistics and machine learning.
- Build transferable skills in reproducible computing that can be applied to other programming languages and analytical environments.

## Objectives
***

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1. Use the R software environment to perform complete data analyses, from data import and cleaning to modeling and reporting.
2. Implement and document statistical and machine learning workflows in R using scripts and literate programming tools, ensuring transparency and reproducibility.
3. Analyze real‑world data sets to extract meaningful insights, critically interpret results, and synthesize conclusions supported by appropriate graphical and numerical evidence.
4. Select and apply suitable supervised and unsupervised learning methods in R, justify their use in context, and assess their performance using relevant diagnostic and validation techniques.
