# While Loop in R with Example {#buttons .tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}
A loop is a statement that keeps running until a condition is satisfied. The syntax for a while loop is the following:
```{r, dont-eval, eval=FALSE}
while (condition) {
     Exp	
}
```

__Note:__ Remember to write a closing condition at some point otherwise the loop will go on indefinitely.

## Example 1:
Let's go through a very simple example to understand the concept of while loop. You will create a loop and after each run add 1 to the stored variable. You need to close the loop, therefore we explicitely tells R to stop looping when the variable reached 10.

__Note:__ If you want to see current loop value, you need to wrap the variable inside the function print().

```{r}
#Create a variable with value 1
begin <- 1

#Create the loop
while (begin <= 10){

#See which we are  
cat('This is loop number',begin)

#add 1 to the variable begin after each loop
begin <- begin+1
print(begin)
}
```

## Example 2:
You bought a stock at price of 50 dollars. If the price goes below 45, we want to short it. Otherwise, we keep it in our portfolio. The price can fluctuate between -10 to +10 around 50 after each loop. You can write the code as follow:

```{r}
set.seed(123)
# Set variable stock and price
stock <- 50
price <- 50

# Loop variable counts the number of loops 
loop <- 1

# Set the while statement
while (price > 45){

# Create a random price between 40 and 60
price <- stock + sample(-10:10, 1)

# Count the number of loop
loop = loop +1 

# Print the number of loop
print(loop)
}

cat('it took',loop,'loop before we short the price. The lowest price is',price)
```
